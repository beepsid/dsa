# Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) Archive

Welcome to my **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) Archive**! This repository is designed to take you on a journey from the basics to mastering data structures and algorithms. Each topic is organized in separate folders with easy-to-follow explanations and example code.

## üìå Project Structure

- Each DSA topic is contained in its own folder.
- Inside each folder, you'll find:
  - **Concept explanations** with example code.
  - **Implementation files** demonstrating various ways to use the structure or algorithm.
  - **Practice problems** that reinforce each concept.
  
Feel free to explore each folder and dive into any topic you're interested in!

## üìÅ Topics Covered

### Core Data Structures
1. [**Patterns**](https://github.com/beepsid/dsa/tree/main/patterns)
1. **Arrays**
2. **Linked Lists**
3. **Stacks**
4. **Queues**
5. **Hash Tables**
6. **Trees**
7. **Graphs**

### Essential Algorithms
1. **Sorting Algorithms** (Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, etc.)
2. **Searching Algorithms** (Binary Search, Depth-First Search, etc.)
3. **Dynamic Programming** (Knapsack Problem, Longest Common Subsequence, etc.)
4. **Greedy Algorithms** (Huffman Encoding, Activity Selection)
5. **Backtracking** (N-Queens, Sudoku Solver)

... and many more!

## üíª Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/beepsid/dsa.git

2. **Navigate to Topic Folders**: Each folder has `README.md` files that explain concepts and implementations.

3. **Run Example Code**: Example codes are in `.py`, `.cpp`, or any language you prefer. Run them directly for practice.
